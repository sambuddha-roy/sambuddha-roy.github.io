In this post, we are going to discuss some common code snippets used in extracting phrases out of text. 
Alternative possibilities exist (for instance using spaCy and tokenization); for this post, we will be using
the popular re package of Python. 

Sample code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import re
def print_hi(name):
   print("hello")
{% endhighlight %}
