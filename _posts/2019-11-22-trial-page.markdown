In this post, we are going to discuss some common code snippets used in extracting phrases out of text. 
Alternative possibilities exist (for instance using spaCy and tokenization); for this post, we will be using
the popular re package of Python. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
